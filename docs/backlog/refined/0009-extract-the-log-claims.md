## Why

The registry allocates rows 0030 to 0039 for the log: the rejection of event sourcing, the arenas, what the log holds, the barrier, and the save format.

The material for these claims was drafted as one record and removed when the
registry was re-derived from claims rather than topics. The reasoning is in
the history and is not lost.[^1]

## Impact review

**Governed by.** The record scope rule. Each row must pass the
three-condition test before its file is written. A row that fails the test is
dropped and its number is retired, rather than written as a weak record.

**Changes.** None. No record exists for these numbers yet.

**Creates.** The records for rows 0030 to 0039, minus any row that fails the test.

**Blockers.** None for the extraction itself. A claim that depends on an open
blocker states its value parametrically and cites the blocker.

**Precedent.** FND-033 records that record length predicts churn. FND-034
records that a claim title predicts a more stable record than a topic title.
Both are why the original record was split.

## Done when

- Every row in 0030 to 0039 either has a file or has been dropped with its number
  retired and the reason recorded.
- Each record holds one claim a reviewer could reject on its own.
- Each record has the context, decision, consequences and references
  sections, and cites its evidence in footnotes.
- No record holds a figure, a version pin, a count, or a module arrangement.
- The record check passes.

## Outcome

Filled in on completion.
